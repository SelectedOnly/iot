# Manage instances

You can purchase instances in the IoT Platform console. After you purchase an instance, you can manage the instance and connect devices to the instance.

## Overview

IoT Platform supports two instance types: public instance and purchased instance.

The public instance is used by default. The products and devices that you create are managed in the public instance.

Purchased instances provide better resource isolation and access control. Purchased instances are isolated from each other. Therefore, purchased instances provide higher data reliability and security.

## Manage an instance

You can view the information of your instance and edit the description name of the instance in the instance details page. You can view the real-time upstream and downstream message TPS and rule engine TPS of the instance. You can also configure alerts for these metrics.

1.  View the information of the instance.

    1.  Log on to the [IoT Platform console](http://iot.console.aliyun.com/).

    2.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **Instances**.

    3.  On the Instances tab of the Instances page, find the instance, and click **View** in the Actions column. The Instance Details page appears.

2.  Edit the description name of the instance.

    On the Instance Details page, click **Edit** next to the description name of the instance.

3.  View the real-time upstream and downstream message TPS and rule engine TPS. Configure alerts for these metrics.

    On the Instance Details page, view the real-time upstream and downstream message TPS and rule engine TPS. To configure an alert for a metric, click **TPS Alert Settings** in the corresponding section. On the Create Alarm Rule page of the Cloud Monitor console, configure an alert for the metric.


## Switch the current instance

After an instance is purchased, you can use the public instance or purchased instance. The type of the current instance is displayed in the upper-left corner of the IoT Platform console. To switch the current instance, you can click the instance type, and then click **Switch** in the message that appears.

View the type of the current instance:

You can view the type of the current instance on the right side of **IoT Platform** in the IoT Platform console.

-   Public: indicates that the current instance is the public instance. The console displays the products, devices, rules, and other resources that you create in the public instance. If you create resources when the current instance is the public instance, the resources can be managed only in the public instance.

-   Instance: indicates that the current instance is a purchased instance. The console displays the products, devices, rules, and other resources that you create in the purchased instance. If you create resources when the current instance is a purchased instance, the resources can be managed only in the purchased instance.

    To view the ID of the current instance, choose **Instances** \> **Instance Settings**.

Before you manage resources in an instance, you must switch to the instance.

1.  In the IoT Platform console, click the instance type next to IoT Platform. In the message that appears, click **Switch** to go to the Instance Settings tab of the Instances page.

2.  On the Instance settings tab, select the instance that you want to switch, and click **Switch Instance**.

    ![Switch](https://static-aliyun-doc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/9948829951/p131458.png)

    After you switch to the instance, you can create products and devices or modify configurations for the instance.


## View the endpoint of an instance

When you use a device SDK, IoT Platform SDK, or AMQP SDK, you must specify the endpoint of an instance.

**Note:**

-   You must specify the corresponding public endpoint of the instance in the following scenarios: Devices that are managed in an instance are connected to IoT Platform over a public network by using MQTT, CoAP, or HTTP. The AMQP server-side subscription feature is used. An IoT Platform API operation is called.
-   You can bind two fixed IP addresses to the MQTT endpoint of a purchased instance.
-   If you use the AMQP server-side subscription feature or call an IoT Platform operation over a VPC, you must specify the corresponding VPC endpoint of the instance.

To view the endpoints of an instance and bind fixed IP addresses to the MQTT endpoint of a purchased instance, perform the following steps:

1.  On the Instances page, click **Instance Settings**.

2.  Under **Current Instance**, check whether the current instance is the target instance whose endpoints you want to view.

    If the current instance is not the target instance, select the target instance.

3.  Click **View Endpoints**. Select an endpoint type to view the corresponding endpoint.

4.  Optional. Bind two fixed IP addresses to the MQTT endpoint of a purchased instance. Click **Configure**. In the message that appears, click **OK**.

    ![Fixed IP address](https://static-aliyun-doc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/9948829951/p131452.png)

    If MQTT devices no longer require the fixed IP addresses, click **Unbind**.
