# Manage instances

You can purchase instances in the IoT Platform console. After you purchase an instance, you can manage the instance and connect devices to the instance.

## Instance types

IoT Platform supports two instance types: public instance and purchased instance.

If you do not purchase an instance, you can create products and add devices in the public instance. After you purchase an instance, you can switch to the purchased instance, and create products and add devices in the purchased instance.

Purchased instances are isolated from each other. Therefore, purchased instances provide a high level of data reliability and security.

## Manage instances

You can view the information of your instances and edit the description names of the instances. The information includes the following metrics: real-time upstream and downstream messages per second \(MPS\) and rules engine MPS. You can configure alerts for these metrics.

1.  View the information of the instance.

    1.  Log on to the [IoT Platform console](http://iot.console.aliyun.com/).

    2.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **Instances**.

    3.  On the Instances tab of the Instances page, find the instance, and click **View** in the Actions column of the instance. You are redirected to the Instance Details page.

2.  View the real-time upstream and downstream messages per second \(MPS\) and rules engine MPS. Configure alerts for these metrics.


## Switch to an instance

After an instance is purchased, you can use the public instance or purchased instance.

In the left-side navigation pane of the IoT Platform console, the instance type appears next to the **IoT Platform** service name.

-   Public: indicates that the public instance is being used. The console shows the products, devices, rules, and other resources that you create in the public instance. If you create resources on the public instance, you can manage these resources only on the public instance.

-   Instance: indicates that a purchased instance is being used. The console shows the products, devices, rules, and resources of an instance that is being used. If you create resources on a purchased instance, you can manage these resources only on the purchased instance.

Before you manage resources on an instance, you must switch to the instance.

1.  Move the pointer over the instance type next to the IoT Platform service name, as shown in the following figure. The **Switch** button appears. Click **Switch**. You are redirected to the Instances page.

2.  On the Instances page, click **Switch** next to an instance to switch to the instance.

    After you switch to the instance, you can create products and devices, or modify configurations for the instance.


## View the endpoint of an instance

When you use a device SDK, IoT Platform SDK, or AMQP SDK, you must specify the endpoint of an instance. For more information about how to use SDKs, see [Device SDKs](/intl.en-US/Device Access/Download device SDKs.md), [IoT Platform SDKs](/intl.en-US/Developer Guide (Cloud)/SDK reference/Download SDKs.md), and [Connect an AMQP client to IoT Platform](/intl.en-US/Communications/Server-side Subscription/Use AMQP server-side subscription/Connect an AMQP client to IoT Platform.md).

**Note:**

-   You must specify the corresponding public endpoint of an instance in the following scenarios: Devices that are managed in the instance are connected to IoT Platform over a public network by using MQTT, CoAP, or HTTP. The AMQP-based server-side subscription feature is used. An IoT Platform API operation is called.
-   You can bind two fixed IP addresses to the MQTT endpoint of a purchased instance.
-   You must specify the corresponding VPC endpoint of the instance in the following scenarios: Devices are connected to IoT Platform over a VPC by using MQTT. The AMQP server-side subscription feature is used. An IoT Platform API operation is called.

To view the endpoints of an instance and bind fixed IP addresses to the MQTT endpoint of a purchased instance, perform the following steps:

1.  In the left-side navigation pane of the IoT Platform console, click **Instances**.

2.  On the Instances page, click **View** next to an instance. You are redirected to the Instance Details page. View the required endpoint on the Instance Information tab.

    ![Endpoints](https://static-aliyun-doc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/9948829951/p131450.png)

3.  Optional. Bind two fixed IP addresses to the MQTT endpoint of a purchased instance. In the Endpoint section of the Instance Details page, click **Configure**. In the dialog box that appears, click **OK** to bind two fixed IP addresses.

    ![Fixed IP address](https://static-aliyun-doc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/9948829951/p131452.png)

    If MQTT devices no longer require the fixed IP addresses, click **Unbind**.

    **Note:**

    -   Fixed IP addresses prevent your DNS records from being updated during IP address expansion of IoT Platform. The IP address may change due to some reasons such as the relocation of the data center of your carrier. We recommend that you use domain names to access the required services. Before an IP address is changed, you will be notified. If your device accesses the fixed IP address rather than the domain name of an endpoint, synchronize the new IP address to the device by sending commands from IoT Platform or performing firmware update. Otherwise, the device cannot connect to IoT Platform.
    -   If you use IoT cards, you can add your fixed IP address to the directional IP address list of the carrier.
