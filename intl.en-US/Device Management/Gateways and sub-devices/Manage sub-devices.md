# Manage sub-devices

This article describes how to associate a gateway with sub-devices.

-   A product and a device are created. The Node Type is set to Gateway device. For more information, see [Create a product](/intl.en-US/Device Access/Create a product.md) and [Create a device](/intl.en-US/Device Access/Create devices/Create a device.md).
-   A product and a device are created. The Node Type is set to Gateway sub-device. A gateway connection protocol is specified. For more information, see [Create a product](/intl.en-US/Device Access/Create a product.md) and [Create a device](/intl.en-US/Device Access/Create devices/Create a device.md).

1.  Log on to the [IoT Platform console](https://iot.console.aliyun.com).

2.  In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Devices** \> **Devices**.

3.  On the Devices page, find the gateway device and then click **View** in the Actions column. The Device Details page appears.

4.  Choose **Sub-device Management** \> **Add Sub-device**.

5.  In the dialog box that appears, select the sub-device to be associated, and then click **OK**.


On the Sub-device management tab, you can perform the following operations:

-   Click **View** in the Actions column to go to the Sub-equipment details page. You can then view the information of the sub-device.
-   Click **Delete** in the Actions column to remove the sub-device from the gateway.

    **Note:** This operation deletes the topological relationship between the sub-device and the gateway, but does not delete the device.
